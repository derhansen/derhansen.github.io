Today I found, that the technique I described in my blogpost about <a href="http://www.derhansen.de/2015/10/fluid-standaloneview-translation-scheduler-task.html" target="_blank">rendering localized Fluid templates in a scheduler task</a> does not work as expected. As long as you want to switch the language used to render the templates only <b>one time</b>, then you're fine. But as soon as you want to switch the language <b>several times</b> (e.g. sending multiple localized e-mails in one request), then you experience that only the first language switch is respected.<br /><br />The root cause for this is the TYPO3 LocalizationUtility, which includes the static&nbsp;<b>translate()</b> method that is used return translated language labels from XLF/XML language files. The LocalizationUtility is not designed to handle multiple language switches in <b>one request</b>, so at this point I'm stuck.<br /><br />I order to keep things simple for the integrator (use one e-mail template with language labels to send out localized e-mails in a scheduler task), I decided to create an own viewHelper which uses a <i>modified version</i> of the LocalizationUtility. The modified version of the LocalizationUtility does not contain any static variables or methods and can be used with dependency injection. You can find the code in this <a href="https://github.com/derhansen/standaloneview" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.<br /><br /><b>Usage</b><br /><br />In my Fluid StandaloneView templates I now use my own translate viewHelper as shown below.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/derhansen/94e4d055b3bec0217a9b.js"></script> The viewHelper uses the <a href="https://github.com/derhansen/standaloneview/blob/master/Classes/Service/LocalizationService.php" target="_blank">LocalizationService</a> (which is the TYPO3 LocalizationUtility with some small modifications - e.g. removed all "static" declarations). As a result of this, all functionality of the original viewHelper / TranslationUtility are remained (e.g. overwriting language labels with TypoScript)<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/derhansen/52d62a63f6802aea4697.js"></script> I extended the original demo extension from my first blogpost so it makes use of the new viewHelper / LocalizationService. The Extension now includes a form, which renders multiple Fluid StandaloneViews in one request and the language is switched for each individual StandaloneView (see result-section in the screenshot below)<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4RDvRxaXRuY/VkjKiW2kEZI/AAAAAAAAQBg/FAaBCp_-G_0/s1600/Bildschirmfoto%2B2015-11-15%2Bum%2B19.09.55.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4RDvRxaXRuY/VkjKiW2kEZI/AAAAAAAAQBg/FAaBCp_-G_0/s400/Bildschirmfoto%2B2015-11-15%2Bum%2B19.09.55.png" width="347" /></a></div>The demo extension also includes a command controller, which includes a command that also renders multiple standaloneViews in one request (see screenshot below)<br /><b><br /></b><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7V9GCPQi50I/VkjQGmdp4rI/AAAAAAAAQBw/cV2xDlJ0BX0/s1600/Bildschirmfoto%2B2015-11-15%2Bum%2B19.31.53.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="115" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7V9GCPQi50I/VkjQGmdp4rI/AAAAAAAAQBw/cV2xDlJ0BX0/s400/Bildschirmfoto%2B2015-11-15%2Bum%2B19.31.53.png" width="400" /></a></div><b><br /></b><b><br /></b>If I don't find any major problems, I will make use of this technique to send out multilingual e-mails in a scheduler task in my <a href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/sf_event_mgt" target="_blank">Event Management Extension</a>.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Final notice</b><br /><br />The technique shown should only be used in the <b>backend context</b> of TYPO3 when you want to render multilingual Fluid StandaloneViews <b>in one request</b>. I'm not very happy with the approach of "just" taking some code from the TYPO3 core and adapting it to my needs, since this is not always a clean solution and it may include some drawbacks.<br /><br /><br />
