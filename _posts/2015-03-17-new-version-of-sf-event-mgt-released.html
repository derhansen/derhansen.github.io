The new version 1.0.0 of <a href="http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/sf_event_mgt" target="_blank">sf_event_mgt</a>&nbsp;has been released. I decided not to increase the version number to 0.5.4 &nbsp;but to start with 1.0.0 now, as the extension runs stable in some projects I maintain and also there is no need to keep the extension in alpha/beta state any more. The new version contains some small bugfixes in the template files and also comes with some nice new features.<br /><br />The <b>double-opt in</b> feature for the confirmation e-mail can now be configured to be <b>optional </b>(settings.registration.autoConfirmation). If the new setting is activated, registrations by participants will automatically be confirmed.<br /><br />For <b>locations </b>it is not possible to add <b>latitude, longitude and a description</b>. This can be useful, if the location should be shown on a map.<br /><br />One feature, that has been requested by multiple users is the <b>iCalendar </b>download. For events, it is now possible to add a link, which downloads the event details as an iCalendar file. To keep things flexible, the iCalendar file is rendered through <b>Fluid</b>, so it is also possible to add own fields to the iCalendar file.<br /><br />The last new major feature is the possibility to <b>create a registration for multiple participants</b> at once. There is a maximum amount of registrations, which can be configured for each event, so a user is not able to book all available places for an event at once.<br /><br />All new features are also described in the <a href="http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/sf_event_mgt/" target="_blank">manual</a> of the extension. Additional details for this release can be found <a href="https://github.com/derhansen/sf_event_mgt/releases" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />Thanks to all users, who gave me feedback end new ideas for the extension!<br /><br />If you find a bug and want to request a feature, please use the <a href="https://github.com/derhansen/sf_event_mgt/issues" target="_blank">issue tracker</a> on GitHub<br /><br />
