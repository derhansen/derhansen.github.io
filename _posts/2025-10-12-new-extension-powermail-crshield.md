Back in **July 2022**, I released the TYPO3 extension [**form_crshield**](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/form_crshield), 
a lightweight solution that adds a challenge/response layer to TYPO3 forms created with ext:forms to protect them from
automated spam submissions. Since then, the extension has been downloaded more than **140,000 times**, proving that the
approach works well for many TYPO3 integrators and projects.

Building on the same concept, I’ve now developed a similar extension for **ext:powermail**, one of the most popular
TYPO3 form extensions. The new extension is called [**powermail_crshield**](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/powermail_crshield), 
provides the same JavaScript-based challenge/response mechanism for Powermail forms and is available for TYPO3 version 
12.4 and 13.4.

## How it works

The challenge/response spam shield adds a hidden input field to every form generated by the TYPO3 Powermail extension.  
This input field contains a pre-calculated value with a unique challenge. A small JavaScript snippet included in the 
page uses that challenge to compute the expected response, which is then validated when the form is submitted.

If the expected response is missing or incorrect, validation for the hidden field fails — and no email is sent.

## Installation and configuration

Installation is straightforward: install the extension via the Extension Manager or Composer and enable the protection
in your TypoScript setup. A detailed description and configuration examples are available in the 
[README on GitHub](https://github.com/derhansen/powermail_crshield/blob/main/README.md).

## A note on spam protection

As with any spam protection technique, there’s **no 100% guarantee** that spam will never slip through. Bots with
JavaScript support or those that specifically reverse-engineer the protection mechanism might still manage to submit 
forms. However, such cases are considered **very unlikely**, as the required effort for attackers is typically too high
compared to the potential “benefit”.
