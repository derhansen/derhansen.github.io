I'm currently digging into Laravel 5 and am using the <b>queue component</b> to put time consuming tasks in a queue, so they can be processed in the background. For performance reasons, I switched from using the <b>database queue driver</b> to use the <b>redis queue driver</b>.&nbsp;My application has a dashboard, which shows the amount of scheduled jobs for each queue in the queue system. Using the database queue driver, I used the following code: <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/derhansen/c9d6edd589d337130afd.js"></script>Using the redis queue driver, Laravel creates a list for each queue on the redis server, so you can easily use the functions from the <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/predis/predis" target="_blank">predis</a> package, to interact with the redis server. To get the <b>amount of jobs in a queue</b> with the <b>redis queue driver</b>, I use the code as shown below.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/derhansen/90a599e249c28b6258a3.js"></script>  <br />I also needed the possibility to <b>remove all jobs in a specific queue</b> at once in my application. To do so, I used the code shown below.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/derhansen/5709b8de3194566f5653.js"></script>
