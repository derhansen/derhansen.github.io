Some&nbsp;old(?) versions of Microsoft Excel replace a dash (<b>#</b>) in an URL with "<b>%20-%20</b>". The following example shows, how Excel transforms URLs:<br /><br /><b>Original URL:</b> <br /><pre>https://www.domain.tld/some/path/#my-anchor</pre><br /><b>URL when clicked in Excel:</b> <br /><pre>https://www.domain.tld/some/path/%20-%20my-anchor</pre><br />This may lead to unexpected behavior on webserver application level e.g. when routing can not be resolved successfully and the request will results in an 404 error.<br /><br />The probably best way would be to fix this behavior "somehow" in Excel, but this does not always seem to be possible as described in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25070176/hyperlink-changes-from-to-20-20-when-clicked-in-excel" target="_blank">this</a> stackoverflow question.<br /><br />In order work around this problem for a certain application on a webserver, I added a simple redirect which replaces the "%20-%20" with a "#" using the following <b>.htaccess rewrite rule</b>:<br /><br /><pre><code>RewriteRule ^(.*)\ \-\ (.*)$ /$1#$2 [NE,L,R=301]<br /></code></pre><br />This is for sure not a general solution for the problem, put works perfectly when you only have to fix incoming links for a given application.
