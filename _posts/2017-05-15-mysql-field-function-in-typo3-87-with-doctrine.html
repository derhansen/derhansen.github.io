When you want to query an Extbase repository for a list of UIDs or PIDs, you usually add a query constraint like <b>query-&gt;in('pid', $pidList)</b> to the query, where $pidList is an array of integers. But what, if you want to control the sorting of the returned records? Lets assume, you want to select the following list of UIDs&nbsp;<b>[5, 3, 4, 1]</b> from your repository and the sorting or the UIDs must <b>remain</b>.<br />Extbase only has the possibility to sort the query result by a given column either <b>ascending</b> or <b>descending</b>, so there is no possibility to control so returned sorting as intended.<br /><br />In order to resolve the problem, I found this very helpful <a href="https://www.rutschmann.biz/blog/post/extbase-datensaetze-aus-uidlist-sortieren/" target="_blank">article</a> from&nbsp;Manfred Rutschmann, where he describes exactly the same situation and offers a solution for the problem, which works great in TYPO3 7.6. Sadly the solution does not work in TYPO3 8.7 LTS and fails with an exception, that e.g. column <i>tx_myext_domain_model_mymodel.uid=5</i> does not exist.<br /><br />Since I'm using MySQL as a database engine, I tried to find a solution, where I could use the <a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/109120/how-does-order-by-field-in-mysql-work-internally" target="_blank">MySQL FIELD-function</a> to apply the special sorting to the ORDER BY clause.<br /><br />Fortunately Doctrine DBAL was integrated in TYPO3 8.7 LTS, which offers an easy and readable way to construct my query. I added the following function to my Extbase repository.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/derhansen/7a638cf99f18ca584ac5f67de9e81151.js"></script> <br />In <b>line&nbsp;31</b> I add my own ORDER BY FIELD clause, where the special sorting is applied<br /><br />Since the queryBuilder just returns an array of database records (where each records is just an array of returned fields/values), I use the TYPO3 DataMapper in <b>line 35</b> to map the returned rows as objects, so the returned QueryResult object will contain objects of the type <b>Mymodel</b><br /><br />The example shown has one little downside, since it only works with a MySQL Database.<br /><br />If you want to get more details about the Doctrine DBAL integration in TYPO3, make sure to read the <a href="https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/CoreApiReference/stable/ApiOverview/Database/Index.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
