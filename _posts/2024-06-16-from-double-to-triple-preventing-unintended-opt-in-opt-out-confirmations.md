Today, double opt-in is the de facto standard for web services that require user subscriptions. This process is 
commonly used for newsletter sign-ups, user account creation or event registration/cancellation.

A typical double opt-in process works as following:

* Users sign up for a service (e.g. newsletter) by entering their email address
* The user receives an email with a link they must click to confirm their action (e.g. newsletter subscription)

One of the main reasons why double opt-in is used, are compliance reasons, since you need to verify, that the user 
did really subscribe to the service. Additionally, the reduction of spam, hardening of user trust or the reduction of 
complaints may be reasons to use a double opt-in process.

### The problem with double opt-in / opt-out

The double opt-in / opt-out process can become problematic in terms of email security due to the behavior of **email 
security gateways** and **virus/malware protection services**. These security systems may **automatically check and open 
links** in emails to scan for potential threats, which can inadvertently interfere with the double opt-in / opt-out
process and lead to the following problems:

* **False confirmations** for the double opt-in or double opt-out process
* When security gateways open links, it creates **false engagement metrics**
* **Non-compliance** if users are subscribed or unsubscribed by automatic link clicking
* Users may become **frustrated**, if subscription/unsubscription did not happen on intention

As an example, my TYPO3 extension [sf_event_mgt](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sf_event_mgt) allows users 
to register for events. To ensure that the registration is intentional, a confirmation email containing both a 
confirmation link and a cancellation link is sent to the user. However, when this email is processed by an email 
security gateway, it can happen that both the **confirmation** and **cancellation** links are **automatically clicked**. 
This can be frustrating for users and leads to unwanted support requests and concerns about the functionality of the 
extension.

### Why you should use tripple opt-in / opt-out

A tripple opt-in / opt-out process addresses the issues found in the double opt-in / opt-out process by adding an 
**additional layer of verification**. This third step involves a final verification action, such as clicking a 
confirmation link or completing a confirmation form, which is displayed after the user clicks the initial action 
link in the email. This step requires a manual action from the user, ensuring the intent of the action is deliberate 
and authentic.

In version 7.5.0 of my TYPO3 extension sf_event_mgt, I have implemented a **tripple opt-in process** for event 
registration and a tripple opt-out process for event cancellation. This feature can be optionally activated via 
TypoScript configuration.

The tripple opt-in process ensures that users confirm their registration through three distinct steps, enhancing 
the security and validity of the registration. Similarly, the tripple opt-in process requires users to confirm 
their cancellation through three steps, preventing unintended cancellations. This additional layer of verification 
helps avoid issues caused by automatic link clicks from email security gateways, enhancing user experience and 
reducing support requests.
