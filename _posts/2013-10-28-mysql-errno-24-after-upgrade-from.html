Today I upgraded one of my <b>Debian Squeeze</b> servers to <b>Debian Wheezy</b>. During the upgrade, <b>MySQL </b>came up with some error messages like shown below:<br /><pre><code><br />[ERROR] /usr/sbin/mysqld: Can't open file: './database/table1.frm' (errno: 24)<br />[ERROR] /usr/sbin/mysqld: Can't open file: './database/table2.frm' (errno: 24)<br />[ERROR] /usr/sbin/mysqld: Can't open file: './database/table3.frm' (errno: 24)<br />[ERROR] /usr/sbin/mysqld: Can't open file: './database/table4.frm' (errno: 24)<br /></code></pre><br />After some research I found out, that the cause of the problem could be, that the mysql process has too many open files. I then added the following to the my.cnf and restarted the mysql service.<br /><pre><code><br />[mysqld]<br />open_files_limit = 10000<br /></code></pre><br />You may adjust the limit to a value of your choice. The default limit for Debian systems is 1024, so I would recommend to set this the limit to a value greater than 1024.<br /><br />After adjusting the open files limit, the mysql server was running fine again.
