I recently migrated a TYPO3 7.6 Website to TYPO3 8.7 and while importing the migrated TYPO3 database on the production server, the import failed with the following MySQL error:<br /><br /><i>ERROR 1709 (HY000) at line 2060: Index column size too large. The maximum column size is 767 bytes.</i><br /><div><br /></div><div>The error occurred for the import of the TYPO3 table sys_refindex. After some research and local debugging I found out, that I locally was using MySQL 5.7 and the production server was using MySQL 5.6, but settings in regard to innodb_large_prefix and innodb_file_format were equal.<br /><br />In order to import the dump from my MySQL 5.7 server to the production MySQL 5.6 Server, I executed the following SQL query before creating the MySQL dump:&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br /><pre><code>ALTER TABLE sys_refindex ROW_FORMAT=DYNAMIC;<br /></code></pre><br />After setting the ROW_FORMAT to DYNAMIC, the database dump from MySQL 5.7 could finally be imported without errors on the MySQL 5.6 production server.<br /><br />
