Today I wanted to connect to a new clients SSH server and received a <b>"Too many Authentication Failures"</b>&nbsp;message just on the first connect to the host. After a short break and some Google research, I found the <b>very simple reason</b> for the message.<br /><br />Since I have several SSH keys in my <b>.ssh/</b> directory, SSH tries to use each of it to connect to the SSH server. So when the SSH server has a very low "<b>MaxAuthTries</b>" setting configured, then the SSH connection may fail before password authentication is offered.<br /><br />In order to connect a SSH servers with a low "MaxAuthTries" setting, you can use the following command:<br /><br /><pre><code><br />ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no user@host.tld<br /><br /></code></pre><br />After using the "PubkeyAuthentication=no" option, I could login to the host and add a SSH public key to the .ssh/authorized_keys file.
