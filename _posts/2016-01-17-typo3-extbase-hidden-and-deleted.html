TYPO3 ExtBase repositories do by default only return <b>non-hidden</b> and <b>non-deleted</b> records. You can easily override this behavior by modifying the default query settings for the given repository. If you for example want to return all FrontendUser (including hidden and deleted) from a TYPO3 website, you can set the query settings as shown below.<br /><br />Now all available FrontendUser records are returned. When you now loop over the queryResult, you will see, that the FrontendUser Objects returned <b>do not contain any information about if the record actually is hidden or deleted</b>.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/derhansen/c24392b434bacded2b16.js"></script><br /><i>Note that the example above shows the assignment of the defaultQuerySettings directly in an action. Typically you define this in the initializeObject method or directly in the repository.</i><br /><i><br /></i>In order to obtain those information, you need to <b>extend the existing FrontendUser</b> domain model with two fields. First, you need to create an own domain model with two properties as shown below (must be located in a extension - usually your own).<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/derhansen/e061663bfff063e0dda1.js"></script> Note that I called the property which indicates if a record is hidden or not "disable" and not "hidden". I could not get the example to work with a property called "hidden".<br /><br />Next you need to add the new fields to the TCA by adding the file fe_users.php with the following content to the folder <b>Configuration/TCA/Overrides</b>.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/derhansen/5a68e54c7dc056f981a8.js"></script> Finally you must add you new domain model as a <b>subclass</b> for the original FrontendUser domain modal and <b>map</b> the two new properties. Add the file ext_typoscript_setup.txt to the root folder of your extension with the following content.<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/derhansen/589c29acac8a3eeab7db.js"></script> Note, that the key in line 6 (in this example "0") must be used in line 12 as recordType.<br /><br />After clearing all caches, ExtBase now returns all FrontendUsers containing the two new properties "<b>deleted</b>" and "<b>disable</b>"<br /><br />
