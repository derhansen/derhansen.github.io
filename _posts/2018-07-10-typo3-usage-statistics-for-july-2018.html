<b>TR;DR</b> - I analyzed&nbsp;48.146.633 websites for TYPO3 usage - the results with aggregated charts can be found <a href="https://www.t3versions.com/statistics-detail/2" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />I'm proud to introduce my latest side project called <b>t3versions</b>. It is a Python (Django) web application to identify, if a website is running TYPO3 and if so, which major version is being used. As a result, TYPO3 websites are saved to the database in order to create an <b>aggregated overview</b> with several charts.<br /><br /><div>Beside the <a href="https://www.t3versions.com/" target="_blank">live check</a> in the frontend part, the application also contains a task queue, which can analyze multiple websites in the background an on multiple servers. I imported a list with 48.146.633 domains of european websites to the task queue and after 21 days, all websites were analyzed.<br /><br />As a result, t3versions did find <b>292.629</b> websites using TYPO3. Those websites are located on servers with 61.269 individual IP Addresses. The archived results including 6 charts (Version overview, Supported version, TLDs, Webservers, Countries and SSL) can be found <a href="https://www.t3versions.com/statistics-detail/2" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br /></div>I will reschedule the background check on a regular basis. If someone can provide me a list with e.g. Asian or US domains, feel free to <a href="mailto:derhansen@gmail.com" target="_blank">contact</a> me.
