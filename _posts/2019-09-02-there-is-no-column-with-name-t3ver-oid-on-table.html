Recently the following error message showed up in a project I was updating to TYPO3 9.5:<br /><pre><code><br />There is no column with name 't3ver_oid' on table 'tx_news_domain_model_news'.<br /></code></pre><br />When you see this message in a TYPO3 project, you should of course first check, if the field is really available in the mentioned table and second, you should check, if extension dependencies are correct.<br /><br />When extending an Extbase extension (in this case ext:news), you must ensure, that the <i>extending extension</i> is <b>loaded after</b> the extension you extend. In order to do so, you must add a dependency to the extension you extend in your ext_emconf.php like shown below (example when extending ext:news):<br /><br /><pre><code><br />'constraints' =&gt; [<br />    'depends' =&gt; [<br />        'news' =&gt; '7.3.0-7.3.99'<br />    ],<br />],<br /></code></pre><br />After adding the dependency, make sure to regenerate PackageStates.php ("Dump Autoload Information" in install tool or "composer dumpautoload"&nbsp; for composer projects)
